\### Thoughts so far

I’ve read the project specification for Project 1. The assignment requires three separate programs (logger, encryption, and driver) that communicate using pipes. I’m implementing it in Python using the subprocess module because it’s faster to build, test, and debug than C, while still meeting the IPC requirement. I verified the Vigenere cipher logic works correctly with sample input (HELLO key, WORLD → DSCWR).  



\### Plan for this session

\- Initialize a Git repository and push it to GitHub.

\- Begin working on the code for logger.py, encryption.py, and driver.py.

\- Document how to run and maintain the project in the README.
